The Scalable core system\r\n2. Additional modules (such as e.g. Chat, Notes, Todos, CRM, ... you name it)\r\n\r\nModules are independent mini applications you can add / remove on the fly.\r\nThey won't clutter / slow down the whole system.\r\nIf a module is missing you are able to build it on your own or contact us so we can build it for you.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the [Scalable GitHub profile](http://github.com/sclbl) to see what modules are already available.\r\n\r\n## How much does it cost?\r\nThe Scalable core functionality and selected modules are free.\r\nThere are additional modules you can buy to extend the functionality of your Scalable system.\r\n\r\n## What about support?\r\nWe support Scalable actively.
